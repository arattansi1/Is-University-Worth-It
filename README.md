# Is University Worth It?

As part of the final project for an Introduction to Data Science course (STAA57), we were asked to determine whether a university education is worth the time, effort and money. 

We utilized various data analysis techniques to better understand the multiple variables at play. Using government data on students entering and leaving university as well as annual consensus data to analyze new graduate income we were able to determine whether post-secondary education is necessary today.
